  selection:
    vendor: "Keysight"
    model: "B2902A"
    rationale: "Best fit for leakage current measurement with voltage sourcing 0.9–1.1 V. Offers lowest current measurement range (10 fA minimum) and best resolution (100 aA). Dual-channel allows future multi-point testing. Supports guarding and 4-wire for low-noise measurements."
    constraints_to_watch:
      - "Use guarded cables and shielding to minimize noise floor for low leakage currents."
      - "Allow adequate settling time after voltage step to stabilize leakage current reading."

  sampling_rate_hz: null
  file_format: null
  units_out: A
assumptions:
  - what: "Voltage sourcing required"
    because: "User specifies measuring leakage current 'across' a voltage setpoint; implies instrument must source voltage and measure current simultaneously."
    confidence: 0.95
  - what: "Tolerance ±0.1 V is for voltage source stability/accuracy"
    because: "Standard interpretation of setpoint tolerances in leakage measurements."
    confidence: 0.9
  - what: "Leakage current range not specified"
    because: "No explicit current range or limit provided; assuming typical leakage measurement requirements (sub-nA to µA)."
    confidence: 0.7
  - what: "Channel 3 refers to DUT terminal or test point identifier"
    because: "User specifies 'channel 3' but selected instruments are single or dual channel; likely refers to DUT pin/pad, not instrument channel."
    confidence: 0.8
gaps:
  - what: "Expected leakage current range or maximum value"
    why_it_matters: "Determines optimal instrument current range selection and integration time settings for best resolution vs. speed tradeoff."
  - what: "Required current measurement resolution or accuracy"
    why_it_matters: "Affects instrument selection if sub-pA resolution is critical; electrometers may be preferred over SMUs for <1 pA."
  - what: "Settling and integration time requirements"
    why_it_matters: "Leakage measurements often require long settling times (seconds to minutes) for stable readings; affects test throughput."
  - what: "Environmental conditions (temperature, shielding, humidity)"
    why_it_matters: "Leakage currents are highly sensitive to temperature and environmental noise; proper shielding and climate control may be required."
